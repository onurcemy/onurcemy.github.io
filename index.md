### About
I am an Environmental Engineer experienced in sustainability, environmental data analysis, groundwater modeling, and stakeholder engagement. I am passionate for developing sustainable solutions for resource management. I have considerable experience in GIS environment and programming languages such as Python and R. I am interested in contributing to interdisciplinary research and practical applications in climate adaptation and nature management.

I received my Master's degree in the field of Environmental Science at [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index), located in İstanbul, Turkey as well as have been working in the [InTheMED, Prima Funded Project](https://inthemedprima.com/) as a research fellow to gain experience in topics such as groundwater modeling and water manangement during my MS studies. My [Master thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V0nL1ceA42lspnTyQzFFYuNpxyw8qlZ1/view?usp=sharing) focuses on estimation of groundwater recharge by simulating UZF-MODFLOW model with five agricultural management scenarios and seventeen regional climate models under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Nadim Copty](https://esc.bogazici.edu.tr/tr/content/nadim-copty). Previously, I had received my Bachelor of Science degree with  honor in the [Environmental Engineering Department](https://enve.metu.edu.tr/) from METU.

### Involved Projects

[Innovative and Sustainable Groundwater Management in the Mediterranean](https://inthemedprima.com/) (InTheMED)
 
My main task in the project was to estimate groundwater recharge in the Konya Closed Basin, a semi-arid region with extensive agricultural lands. I engaged in multiple interactive sessions with farmers and policymakers to explain the causes and results of groundwater depletion. Within the InTheMED project, I participated in machine learning model development and system dynamic model development, to compare different modeling approaches with the process-based model.

[Smart Campus Project](https://tf.metu.edu.tr/en/ids-spring19/)
 
Collaborating with my team, our primary focus centered on crafting sustainable and intelligent transportation solutions within the METU campus environment. Our main achievement was the creation of METUNAVI, a platform rewarding pedestrians and hitchhikers with incentives. This initiative aimed to promote eco-friendly mobilization within campus.

### Scholarships & Honors
- DAAD Scholarship for 5th International Summer School on Managed Aquifer Recharge at HTW Dresden. Dresden, Germany. (July 2023)
- Placed Honor Roll (x2) and High Honor Roll (x2) of Middle East Technical University.
