### About
I received my Master's degree in the field of Environmental Science at [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index), located in İstanbul, Turkey as well as have been working in the [InTheMED, Prima Funded Project](https://inthemedprima.com/) as a research fellow to gain experience in topics such as groundwater modeling and water manangement during my MS studies. My [Master thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V0nL1ceA42lspnTyQzFFYuNpxyw8qlZ1/view?usp=sharing) focuses on estimation of groundwater recharge by simulating UZF-MODFLOW model with five agricultural management scenarios and seventeen regional climate models under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Nadim Copty](https://esc.bogazici.edu.tr/tr/content/nadim-copty). Previously, I had received my Bachelor of Science degree with  honor in the [Environmental Engineering Department](https://enve.metu.edu.tr/) from METU. My research interests include but are not limited to water management, impact of climate change on water resources, and remote sensing.
